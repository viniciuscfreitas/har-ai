# Clarify Task

Before doing ANY coding work: understand the problem first. Don't assume requirements - ask until you're confident. Avoid building the wrong thing expensively.

1. **Ask clarifying questions** - Use 2-4 targeted questions to avoid assumptions:

    - What's the actual user problem this solves?
    - MVP scope: what's absolutely required vs nice-to-have?
    - What are the real constraints (tech, time, budget)?
    - How will success be measured?

2. **Restate requirements** - After I answer, restate the final requirements in your own words to confirm understanding.

3. **Confirm before proceeding** - Only then ask if ready to proceed to implementation.

Keep asking until confident. Better to over-communicate than build wrong.

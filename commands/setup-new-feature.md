# /setup: Clarify, Feature Setup & Roadmap

Before coding: understand the problem. Avoid building the wrong thing expensively.

## 1. Clarify (Understand First)
- Ask 2-4 targeted questions to avoid assumptions about user problems and scope.
- Restate requirements in your own words to confirm understanding.
- Confirm before proceeding to implementation.

## 2. Feature Setup (Minimal Viable)
- Identify the core problem and build the minimal version first.
- Branch from main with a clear name.
- Only add planning complexity if touching multiple systems or coordination is needed.

## 3. Roadmap (Gaps & Impact)
- Scan for obvious gaps: missing logging, bottlenecks, or hard-to-read code.
- Prioritize by effort vs impact and ask which to tackle first.

# Roadmap: Feature & Improvement Suggestions

Create roadmap only when needed. Most codebases don't need speculative roadmaps - focus on current problems first.

Scan codebase for obvious gaps, then ask user what they actually want to build.

## Quick Assessment

Look for 2-3 obvious improvements:

- Missing error handling or logging
- Performance bottlenecks
- Code that's hard to understand

## Simple Output

1. List 3-5 concrete improvements found
2. Prioritize by effort vs impact
3. Ask: "Which of these should we tackle first?"

No diagrams unless specifically requested - text is usually clearer.

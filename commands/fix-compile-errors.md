# Fix Compile Errors

Fix obvious compilation errors that prevent the code from running. Focus on syntax, imports, and basic type issues. If there are many errors, the code needs bigger fixes.

## Simple Fixes First

- Missing imports: add them
- Undefined variables: declare or import them
- Basic syntax errors: fix typos
- Type mismatches: add proper types

Stop at complex architectural issues - those need design changes, not quick fixes.

## Verify It Compiles

After fixes, ensure code compiles cleanly. Report what was changed in 1-2 sentences.
